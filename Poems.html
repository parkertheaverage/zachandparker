<h1>Poems that make me think of you</h1>
<p>My love for you is like a blazing wave,

    Will forever be so deep, powerful and intense
    
    Could survive through any storm, wind and heavy rain
    
    and will shattered every pain.
    
    Our hearts are so gentle and love so pure
    
    Iâ€™ll keep loving you, I know for sure.</p>
    <p>A million stars up in the sky.
        One shines brighter - I can't deny.
        A love so precious, a love so true,
        a love that comes from me to you.
        </p>
    <p>My love for you is like the raging sea,
    So powerful and deep it will forever be.
    Through storm, wind, and heavy rain,
    It will withstand every pain.</p>
    <p>When you smile at me, I lose myself.
        You give me this feeling that makes me overwhelmed.
        When your hand is in mine, I feel totally fine,
        And that's the reason I had to make you mine.
        </p>
        <p>L is for "laughter" we had along the way.
            O is for "optimism" you gave me every day.
            V is for "value" of being my best friend.
            E is for "eternity," a love that has no end.
            </p>
            <p>When I say I love you, please believe it's true.
                When I say forever, know I'll never leave you.
                When I say goodbye, promise me you won't cry,
                Because the day I'll be saying that will be the day I die.
            

                <p>If roses were red and violets could be blue,
                    I'd take us away to a place just for two.
                    You'd see my true colors and all that I felt.
                    I'd see that you could love me and nobody else.
                    </p>
                    <p>A squillion stars shine in the sky.
                        Soaring angels sing sweet songs nearby.
                        I wake and smile, my dreams are true.
                        The star in my arms, my sun, is you.
                        </p>
