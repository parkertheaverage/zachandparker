        <p>In a digital landscape where love often lurks behind screens, our story began in the modern realm of Tinder. It wasn't an instant connection but a gradual unfolding of fate, delayed by unforeseen circumstances. A heart monitor tethered them to uncertainty, yet they patiently awaited their destined encounter.
